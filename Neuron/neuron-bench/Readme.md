# 🧠 NeuronBench: Benchmarking What Breaks First in AI Systems

**NeuronBench** is a diagnostic benchmark suite designed to evaluate how different AI architectures perform under real-world failure modes — where context collapses, tone is misunderstood, and ambiguity derails resolution.

It’s not just about accuracy — it’s about **resilience**, **adaptability**, and the ability to recover when things get messy. Based on the “What Breaks First?” experiment series, this project turns diagnostic insight into reproducible benchmarks.


## What NeuronBench Tests

NeuronBench focuses on benchmarking AI systems across complex, high-friction scenarios that typically break brittle systems:

- **Ambiguity** — Indirect, polite, or unclear requests
- **Tone Masking** — Urgency hidden under courteous language
- **Translation Drift** — Meaning loss across multilingual phrasing
- **Compliance Conflicts** — Contradictory legal requirements across jurisdictions
- **Legacy Format Issues** — Ambiguous dates, mixed units, outdated schemas
- **Mixed Format Inputs** — Inputs combining plain text, JSON, shorthand, or metadata

Each test case is designed to challenge the system’s contextual awareness, decision-making hierarchy, and fallback strategies.

##  Benchmark Format

Each case contains:
```json
{
  "id": "ambig_001",
  "input_text": "I guess I’m just wondering if someone could maybe help.",
  "expected_output": {
    "intent": "support_request",
    "tone": "passive-aggressive",
    "urgency": "high",
    "confidence": {
      "tone": 0.93,
      "intent": 0.91
    }
  }
}
```

##  Output Metrics

After execution, NeuronBench will generate:
-  Pass/Fail score by system and scenario
- 🧠 Detailed analysis of misclassifications
-  Confidence score tracking and reporting
-  Fallback paths used (if applicable)
-  Optional visualizations: side-by-side charts, confusion matrices, error types

---

##  Quick Start

Run all benchmarks:
```bash
python scripts/run_bench.py --config config/thresholds.yaml
```

Compare outputs across systems:
```bash
python scripts/compare_results.py
```

---

##  GitHub Actions Integration

To integrate NeuronBench into your CI pipeline:

```yaml
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  run-neuron-bench:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: python scripts/run_bench.py --config config/thresholds.yaml
```

This ensures every PR is automatically validated for regression or fragility against known edge cases.

---

## 🧠 Why NeuronBench?

Because what fails first isn’t syntax.  
It’s **context**, **tone**, **urgency**, and **human nuance**.

NeuronBench offers a ground truth for real-world AI fragility — and demonstrates how **modular, agent-based architectures like Neuron** outperform static function-call systems or brittle rule engines.

This is a benchmark suite for:
- Researchers testing new reasoning models
- Teams evaluating robustness in production
- Builders seeking resilience over novelty
